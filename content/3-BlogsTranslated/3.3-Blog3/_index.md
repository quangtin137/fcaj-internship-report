# INTERNAL AI FOR ENTERPRISES: WHEN EMPLOYEES DON’T NEED TO SEARCH EVERY FOLDER FOR INFORMATION

![Internal AI Assistant Architecture with Amazon Bedrock](/fcaj-internship-report/images/3-BlogsTranslated/blog3.jpg)

Data in enterprises is usually not in one single place. Some might be in Google Drive, some in SharePoint, some in CRM or ERP. Internal processes might be in PDF files. Customer FAQs might be in the ticket system. Other information might be in emails, Excel files, or department-specific folders.

The problem isn’t that the enterprise doesn’t have data. The problem is that data is scattered, hard to find, hard to version control, and sometimes employees don’t know which is the latest document. A salesperson wants to find the latest discount policy. An HR staff wants to check the leave process. A support rep wants to know how to handle a common customer error. A new hire wants to look at onboarding materials.

If they have to manually search across multiple systems, this takes time. Worse, employees might accidentally use old or outdated information. From this problem, a very practical question arises: Can we build an internal AI Assistant for employees to ask questions directly about company documents?

No need to start with an overly large system. No need to build an AI that knows everything in the enterprise from day one. The first version just needs to be simple enough to test if this idea is actually useful.

## 1. START WITH A SMALL SCOPE

If you try to deploy an AI Assistant for the entire enterprise from the beginning, the problem becomes very complex. Each department has different types of data. Each system has different storage methods. Document sensitivity levels also vary. If you start too broad, when the system doesn’t answer well, the team will have a hard time figuring out where the problem is.

A more reasonable approach is to choose a small scope first. For example, you could start with: HR policies, leave processes, onboarding materials for new hires, product FAQs, common ticket handling processes, or frequently asked internal guide documents.

These document groups have in common that their content is relatively clear, easy to verify, and frequently asked by employees. The initial goal is not to build an AI that knows everything in the company. A more realistic goal is: Employees ask questions, the system searches in verified internal documents, then answers with clear source citations.

For example, a user asks: “What do I need to do to request 2 days of leave?” A normal answer might be: “You need to create a leave request and send it to your manager for approval.” That sounds right, but in an enterprise environment, it’s not enough. A better answer should be: “According to the 2026 Leave Process document, employees need to create a leave request on the HRM system at least 3 working days in advance and wait for direct manager approval. Source: 2026 Leave Process - HR Team.”

The difference is in the source. With enterprise data, an answer that sounds reasonable is not enough. Users need to know which document the answer comes from, whether it’s still valid, and whether they can verify it.

## 2. INITIAL AWS ARCHITECTURE

In the first version, the architecture can stay simple:
Internal documents → Amazon S3 → Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases → AWS Lambda + API Gateway → Internal web chat → Employees get answers with sources.

Simply put, the enterprise selects a set of verified documents and stores them on Amazon S3. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports indexing and retrieving relevant content when users ask questions. Instead of letting AI answer intuitively, the system will base answers on the provided internal documents to create more appropriate responses.

AWS Lambda handles the backend processing, such as receiving user questions, calling the Knowledge Base, receiving retrieval results, and returning responses to the web interface. Amazon API Gateway acts as the API gateway between frontend and backend, helping the internal chat web communicate clearly and easily with Lambda.

If login is needed, enterprises can add Amazon Cognito to only allow employees access to the system. Amazon CloudWatch can be used to monitor logs, check errors, and record questions that the system hasn’t answered well.

The important point is that the first version doesn’t need to connect to all systems like CRM, ERP, Google Drive, or SharePoint. Enterprises can start by manually selecting an important group of documents, uploading them to Amazon S3, and testing with a small group of users. This approach helps the team focus on the most important question: Does this AI Assistant actually help employees find information faster, more accurately, and more reliably?

## 3. WHAT’S WORTH NOTING ABOUT AMAZON BEDROCK MANAGED KNOWLEDGE BASE?

When building a question-answering system on internal data, many teams will think of RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Simply put, RAG is a way for AI not only to rely on the model’s existing knowledge, but also to retrieve additional data from the enterprise’s own document sources before generating answers.

However, if you build a RAG pipeline from scratch, teams usually have to handle quite a few parts: connecting data from multiple sources, cleaning and standardizing documents, splitting document content, creating embeddings, managing vector databases, optimizing retrieval, re-ranking results, monitoring logs and performance, controlling access permissions, and updating data when documents change.

These parts aren’t too simple, especially when enterprise data is in many places and in many different formats. Amazon Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base helps reduce this complexity by managing many components of the RAG pipeline, from ingestion, indexing, storage to retrieval infrastructure.

The notable point is that developers can focus more on the application, user experience, and business logic, instead of having to build the entire data retrieval infrastructure from scratch. Some highlights include: Support for connecting data from sources like Amazon S3, SharePoint, Confluence, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Web Crawler; support for processing many different data formats for information retrieval; advanced retrieval capabilities for complex questions; ability to answer with citations so users can check sources; can integrate with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build AI Agents with internal knowledge retrieval capabilities.

In short, instead of having to build the entire RAG system yourself, enterprises can use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases or Managed Knowledge Base as a foundation layer to bring internal data into Generative AI applications faster and with more control.

## 4. WHAT MATTERS IS NOT JUST THE MODEL, BUT THE DATA

When talking about AI, many people often ask: “Which model to use?”, “Which model is the strongest?”, “Which model gives the best answers?”. But for internal document question-answering, more important questions should be: “Is the data clean?”, “Is the document still valid?”, “Is the source clear?”, “Who is responsible for updating the document?”, “Are there multiple duplicate versions?”, “Does the user have permission to view that document?”.

If data is outdated, duplicated, or has unclear sources, AI will easily give wrong answers. If the same policy has three different versions, the system will also have trouble knowing which one to rely on. Therefore, before putting documents into the AI Assistant, enterprises should have a step for selecting and standardizing data.

No need to make it too complicated from the start, but each document should have some basic information like: Document name, responsible department, document type, effective date, Owner, source link, and status (still valid or outdated).

Example:
- Document name: 2026 Leave Process
- Department: HR
- Document type: Policy
- Effective date: 01/01/2026
- Owner: HR Team

These small details help the system give more reliable answers. At the same time, the operations team will also easily know which documents need updating, which need to be removed, and which are most frequently asked by users.

## 5. WHAT TO DO IN THE FIRST VERSION

In my opinion, the first version should focus on what’s truly necessary.

**Should do:**
- Choose one department or a specific document group
- Only use documents confirmed to still be valid
- Build a simple Q&A interface
- Answers must have sources
- Record questions the system hasn’t answered well
- Let users rate whether answers are correct
- Check if the AI Assistant actually helps save search time

**Don’t do too many things at once:**
- Don’t need to connect to all company systems yet
- Don’t need an overly complex dashboard yet
- Don’t need too detailed permission control from the start
- Don’t need to integrate Teams or Slack right away
- Don’t put overly sensitive documents into the testing phase

The reason is that if the scope is too broad, when the system doesn’t answer well, the team will have a hard time identifying the cause. It could be unclean data, document splitting not being reasonable, prompts not being good, unclear access permissions, or users asking outside the scope of provided documents. Starting small makes checking, measuring, and improving much easier.

## 6. HOW TO MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS?

An internal AI system shouldn’t be judged by the feeling that it “seems good”. After some testing time, look at specific metrics.

Examples:
- How many users tried it?
- How many questions per day?
- How many answers have clear sources?
- How many questions don’t find a suitable document?
- Do users rate answers as correct or incorrect?
- Which topics are asked most often?
- Which documents are most frequently retrieved?
- Which questions does the system not answer well?

If many questions don’t have answers, the document set might not be sufficient. If answers have sources but are still inaccurate, you might need to review how documents are processed, split, or tagged with metadata. If users don’t use it much, the chosen problem might not be “painful” enough, the interface might not be convenient, or employees don’t yet see the clear value of the tool. This feedback is more important than trying to build a very large architecture from the start.

## 7. WHEN SHOULD WE SCALE UP?

After the first version runs stably and has real users, enterprises can scale step by step. First add more documents in the same department. Then expand to other departments. Next, you can automatically sync from SharePoint, Google Drive, Confluence, or internal systems.

When there’s more data, that’s when you need to think more about permissions, audit logs, dashboards, guardrails, and integration with daily tools like Teams, Slack, or internal portals. In other words, the system doesn’t need to become an “Enterprise Knowledge Hub” from day one. It can start as a small tool to help employees find documents faster, then gradually grow into a shared knowledge access layer for the enterprise.

---

## CONCLUSION

Scattered data is a very common problem in enterprises. Before AI, this problem already made employees spend a lot of time searching for information. When starting to apply AI, this problem becomes even clearer, because AI can only answer well when input data is clear, up-to-date, and reliable.

With AWS, a practical approach is to start with an internal AI Assistant for a small document group: → Amazon S3 → Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases → Lambda + API Gateway → Internal web chat → Answers with sources.

The most important thing isn’t using a lot of AWS services. The important thing is choosing the right scope, choosing the right data, and always requiring answers with sources. Because in an enterprise environment, AI doesn’t just need to answer quickly. AI needs to answer based on the right documents, the right context, and be reliable enough for users to use in their daily work.
