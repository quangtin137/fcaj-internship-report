# AUTOMATING AWS COST MANAGEMENT WITH FINOPS AGENT ON AMAZON BEDROCK AGENTCORE

When enterprises use multiple AWS accounts and many cloud services, cost control is no longer as simple as just looking at end-of-month reports. To solve this problem, AWS introduces the FinOps Agent built on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, helping users query AWS cost data in natural language, receive analysis on cost drivers, budgets, anomalies, and resource optimization recommendations. In my opinion, the strength of this solution is that the Agent does not replace tools like Cost Explorer or Compute Optimizer, but instead plays the role of aggregating data, interpreting results, and supporting faster cost optimization actions.

## SOME HIGHLIGHTS

- **Using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: AgentCore is used to run the FinOps Agent, process questions, call the right AWS tools, and return cost analysis results in easy-to-understand language.
- **Leveraging AWS Cost Explorer**: The Agent can identify which service, account, region, or usage type is contributing the most to costs. For example, when costs increase abnormally, the Agent can analyze whether the cause comes from EC2, S3, NAT Gateway, RDS, or data transfer.
- **Leveraging AWS Budgets**: The Agent can compare current usage with budgets, warn about budget overrun risks, and suggest which teams need to check.
- **Leveraging AWS Compute Optimizer**: The Agent can get recommendations to detect over-provisioned resources, for example EC2 instances with configurations too high compared to actual needs, thereby suggesting resizing instances or adjusting workloads more appropriately.
- **Query costs in natural language**: Users can ask: "Which service is costing the most this month?", "Which account has abnormal cost increases?" or "Are there any EC2 resources being used inefficiently?".
- **Supports coordination between Finance and DevOps**: Finance can ask about budgets, while DevOps can dive deeper into resources, workloads, and technical recommendations. This helps teams understand cost issues in a more accessible way together.

## PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE

In my opinion, the FinOps Agent has the most practical value when an enterprise already uses many AWS services and cloud costs are no longer easy to control manually. At that point, the issue is not just "how much does it cost", but "why did it increase", "where did it increase", "who is responsible", and "what actions can optimize it".

For example, if Cost Explorer shows EC2 costs have increased, that number alone is not enough to make a decision. The enterprise needs to know which instances increased, if they're running the right workloads, if they've been forgotten, if rightsizing is possible, or if Savings Plans should be considered. This is when the FinOps Agent can aggregate many signals to provide easier-to-understand analysis.

## SOME LIMITATIONS TO NOTE

- AI Agent does not completely replace FinOps experts, especially with production workloads.
- Analysis quality depends heavily on input data such as tagging, account structure, and cost allocation.
- Rightsizing should not be applied mechanically, as some workloads still need headroom for peak hours.
- Access control needs to be managed because the Agent can query sensitive cost data.
- The Agent itself also incurs inference costs, so usage still needs to be monitored.

## CONCLUSION

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is not just for building chatbots, but can be directly applied to cloud cost management and optimization problems. When combined with Cost Explorer, Budgets, Compute Optimizer, and Pricing, the FinOps Agent helps enterprises control costs more proactively, detect waste earlier, and make resource optimization decisions faster. However, for the solution to be effective, enterprises still need a good data foundation such as clear tagging, proper account segregation, correctly configured budgets, and a process to review recommendations before applying them.
