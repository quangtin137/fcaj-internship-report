## Objective

Document CloudTrail, SNS, and DLQ alarm evidence without over-claiming production operation.

CloudTrail trail evidence has been captured, including logging and log delivery, but the production audit scope should be verified before claiming full operational coverage.

Tin's supplementary CloudTrail screenshots can be used as configured AWS evidence when present.

SNS subscription evidence shows a `Confirmed` email subscription, but alarm email delivery is not claimed without mailbox evidence.

DLQ CloudWatch Alarm evidence shows the alarm state and enabled actions, but SNS action target and email delivery are not claimed unless visible in the captured evidence.

The SNS test notification screenshot can be included only as evidence for the visible test scope.
