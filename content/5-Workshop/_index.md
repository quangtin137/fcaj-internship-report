## Overview

This workshop documents the FCAJ Hybrid SOC/AWS project: a hybrid SOC pipeline that starts from local security evidence, moves events into AWS, processes them through cloud data services and AI/Fusion components, and prepares final alerts for downstream storage, monitoring, and dashboard views.

The current workshop is organized into 11 main sections, fully documented with verified configuration details and screenshots.
