## Objective

Document the current AI2A/AI2B status and validate how the dashboard communicates data-source state to the analyst.

AI2A and AI2B are kept as integration s unless final model artifacts and backend integration evidence are available. The dashboard must make mock, replay, or real API mode visible.

The mock environment evidence shows that the dashboard can run while backend integration is still being completed.

The real API environment screenshot is  and should only be used to explain how the endpoint is configured, not to expose private domains or tokens.

The mock status evidence is acceptable for UI validation, but it must not be described as live telemetry.

If real API evidence is available, this screenshot can show the dashboard connected to backend data. The text should still state the exact scope of what was validated.
