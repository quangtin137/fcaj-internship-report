## Objective

Verify S3 bucket security, lifecycle/cost-control status, and IAM permissions for the backend and worker roles.

## Step 1: Verify bucket security

The S3 Data Bucket contains security evidence, so Block Public Access must remain enabled and default encryption should be active.

## Step 2: Review lifecycle and cost-control status

Lifecycle rules can help expire temporary raw evidence or move older objects to cheaper storage classes. If the rule is not fully configured, keep this as a cost-control .

## Step 3: Verify backend IAM permissions

The backend role `socai-dev-backend-role` should be allowed to send messages to the SQS main queue and write objects to the S3 Data Bucket.

## Step 4: Verify worker IAM permissions

The worker role `socai-dev-ai-worker-role` should be allowed to receive/delete SQS messages and read required S3 objects.
