## Objective

Validate SQS and S3 manually before backend integration evidence is available.

## Step 1: Send a manual SQS message

Use the SQS console or CloudShell to send a test message to `socai-dev-normalized-zeek-events-queue`. This proves the queue can accept messages, but it does not prove backend integration.

## Step 2: Upload a manual S3 object

Upload a test object to the expected Zeek HTTP prefix in `socai-dev-data-************`. This proves the bucket and prefix are usable, but it does not prove the backend has called `put_object`.

## Result

Manual validation confirms that the SQS and S3 resources are ready for backend integration. Backend-created evidence remains pending.
