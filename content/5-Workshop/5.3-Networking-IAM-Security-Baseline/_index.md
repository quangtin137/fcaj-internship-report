## Introduction

This section checks the **network, IAM, and security baseline** so the EC2 Backend can run safely and connect to necessary services like SQS, S3, RDS, Secrets Manager, and CloudWatch.

Contents to check include:

- VPC
- Subnets
- Route Tables
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Security Groups
- IAM Role for EC2 Backend

If any service is not configured yet, clearly state **not configured** or **extension phase**, do not claim it is deployed.

## Goals

After this section, the implementer should be able to identify:

- The VPC being used for the project.
- Which subnets are used for public, app, and database layers.
- Which route tables are for public/private subnets.
- Whether a NAT Gateway exists or not.
- Which ports are open on the Backend Security Group.
- Whether the EC2 Backend uses an IAM Role instead of access keys.
